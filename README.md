## About

You can generate estimated time-series hydropower data through an USGS API or providing data containing time-series flow.

Kindly follow [Generalized](/My_Code/My_HAT/Using_Hydro_Code_Generalized.ipynb) or [Timeseries](/My_Code/My_HAT/Using_Hydro_code_Timeseries.ipynb) for steps to use the code.
